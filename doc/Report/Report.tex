\section{Executive Summary}

We designed a web application that helps bassoonists of all skill
levels find and learn new fingerings with an easy to use interface.

Bassoon fingerings can be very difficult to learn, especially because
there can be multiple fingerings for one note. Beginners and professionals
alike have the need to lookup fingerings for a note, usually in a
specific passage, to be sure they are using the appropriate fingering.
Bassoonists need to be able to access this tool via a personal computer,
a tablet (iPad, etc.), or smart-phone (Android, iPhone, etc.), and
would need to be able to easily search for fingerings for a specific
note. They also need to be able to add new fingerings, edit and delete
fingerings, and 'like'/'dislike' fingerings, as well as view fingerings
based on skill level.

This application will be beneficial to many bassoonists because it
gives them an easy way to find fingerings for specific notes based
on their skill level. It also gives bassoonists a social medium for
sharing fingerings, as well as suggestions and preferences for certain
fingerings.


\section{Background}


\subsection{Motivation}

The Bassoon Fingering Finder Team is very interested in evolutionary
computation and artificial intelligence, as well as mobile applications.
This project will not only help bassoonists, but also allowed the
BFF team to explore methods for using evolutionary computation and
artificial intelligence in a full software project. Also, because
the application needed to be compatible across multiple platforms,
it also gave the team experience with compatibility and mobile applications.


\subsection{Need}

Currently bassoonists have very few options when it comes to finding
fingerings quickly (which many times imperative during a concert or
recital). There are books listing hundreds of standard fingerings,
as well as an mobile fingering application with limited capabilities.
Bassoonists need a way to access fingerings quickly and be able to
search for fingerings they need. Also, because bassoonists have no
social medium for discussing preferences or suggestions for fingerings,
or receiving help for certain fingerings, it would also be helpful
to have an application that not only helped bassoonists find fingerings,
but also allowed them to communicate with fellow bassoonists.


\subsection{Benefits}

This project will benefit bassoonists, from beginners to professionals,
and will provide a way for bassoonists to communicate through a bassoon
specific application. Bassoonists will be able to add, edit, delete,
view, and search for bassoon fingerings with an easy to use graphical
interface, as well as manage fingerings they have added, 'like'/'dislike'
fingerings, and access the application via personal computer or mobile
devices.

\subsection{Team Responsibilities}

Jacob's primary task was the infrastructure. He worked to get the
user authentication, time zone specification, and skill level functioning.
He setup the ability for users to be able to view and edit their 'profile'
information, containing their skill level, email address, etc. Once
those tasks were done, he moved to work on bug reports and assist
with the application section when needed.

Sasha's primary task was implementing the mailer and search capabilities.
The mailer was used to automatically email users when they registered
for the site, as well as when they forgot their password (the mailer
would email a new temporary password). Implementing the search involved
querying the database for appropriate fingerings, rating fingerings,
and sorting/prioritizing fingerings. She created an algorithm that
would appropriately rate fingerings based on their like/dislike scores
that would appropriately weight fingerings. This algorithm then took
into account the skill level of users and prioritized fingerings that
had skill levels close to the user's skill level. Thus, when users
searched for fingerings of a specific note, the resulting fingerings
were ordered to show users fingerings that were rated highly and that
are appropriate for the user's skill level. Sasha also designed and
completed the BFF poster for the Engineering EXPO. 

Max's primary task was the JavaScript, HTML5, \& CSS related parts.
He mainly worked on the HTML5+JavaScript canvas for the note/fingering
entry, editing, and display. He also worked on the browser side validation
JavaScripts for the various forms on the website. He worked on adapting
a free CSS template for use on the site and added various CSS rules
for things like tabs and tables. Lastly he handled filtering most
bug reports to their respective developers, i.e. filtering user bugs
to Jacob and search bugs to Sasha.


\section{Concepts Considered}


\subsection{Implementation Model: Web application vs. Fully Mobile}

Though the project proposal suggested the model be implemented via
a web application, our sponsor voiced the need to have the application
be functional on mobile devices as well. Though it would be an interesting
opportunity to build a fully mobile application, the team had no experience
with building mobile applications.


\subsection{Programming Language: Python/Django vs. Ruby/Rails}

Originally, we considered using python with the django web framework
to develop the application. Both languages are scripting languages
that lend themselves to web development. All members of the team had
experience working with Python and Django previously on the software
engineering project for CS383/384. However, Ruby/Rails is ubiquitous
in web development currently and would be an opportunity to learn
a new language and web framework.


\subsection{Applet Language: Java vs. Flash vs. JavaScript+HTML5 }

Java and flash are both often used in web development to build applets
and therefore are well supported on most modern PC browsers with up
to date plugins. However, mobile browsers this is not the case with
Java applets unable to run on Android and iPhone, and Flash only running
on newer versions of the Android OS. JavaScript+HTML5 is fairly new
but runs on any browser including mobile devices albeit with varying
levels of support for various features, and requires no extra plugins
to install and keep up to date.


\subsection{Validation Methods: In-house vs. Devise}

Because the application was fairly small and specific, the team decided
in-house validation may be easier and better suited to the application.
However, as the application continued to develop, it became a much
larger application than originally modeled. The validation plug-in,
Devise, provides built-in validation tools that are easy to integrate
with applications.


\subsection{Search Results Rating Algorithm: Ratio Rating vs. Confidence Interval
Rating}

The simple rating algorithm involved finding the ratio of `likes'
and `dislikes' of a fingering (i.e. likes divided by likes plus dislikes).
However, this rating algorithm could possibly rate fingerings inappropriately.
For example, if fingering one had 100 likes and 50 dislikes, while
fingering two had 1 like and no dislikes, fingering 2 would be rated
higher than fingering one, even though fingering 1 should be rated
higher.


\section{Concept Selection}


\subsection{Implementation Model: Web application vs. Fully Mobile}

Because the sponsor still wanted a mobile application in addition
to a web application, the team decided to implement a mobile compatible
web application to cater to users of both PC's and mobile devices.


\subsection{Programming Language: Python/Django vs. Ruby/Rails}

However, the team decided that gaining experience working with Ruby
on Rails, which is ubiquitous in web application development, would
be prudent.


\subsection{Applet Language: Java vs. Flash vs. JavaScript+HTML5}

Since the application was to be mobile device compatible JavaScript+HTML5
was chosen for the language of the applet that was to handle the entering,
display, and editing of bassoon key fingerings.


\subsection{Validation Methods: In-house vs. Devise}

However, after trying to implement Devise on partially implemented
application, it became apparent that the application was too far along
in development to gain use from Devise.


\subsection{Search Results Rating Algorithm: Ratio Rating vs. Confidence Interval
Rating}

The team decided to use a more accurate rating algorithm that take
into account the volume of likes/dislikes and how well received the
fingering is (i.e. if it is `controversial'). The algorithm used is
as follows:

\[
(\hat{p}+z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}^{2}\pm z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sqrt{(\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})+z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}^{2}/4n)/n})/(1+z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}^{2}/n)
\]


Where $\hat{p}=\frac{1}{n}$ and $z=1.96$ (for a 95\% confidence
interval).


\section{System Architecture}


\subsection{Conceptual Design}

Conceptually, the web application would be based on a Model-View-Controller
architecture: 

The user interacts with the user interface (e.g. adding fingerings). 

The controller handles the input event from the user interface, and
converts the event into an appropriate user action understandable
for the model. 

The controller notifies the model of the user action (e.g. adding
the fingering to the database).

A view queries the model to generate an appropriate user interface
(for example the view lists the shopping cart's contents). The view
gets its own data from the model. In some implementations, the controller
may issue a general instruction to the view to render itself. In others,
the view is automatically notified by the model of changes in state
(observer) that require a screen update. 

The user interface waits for further user interactions, which restarts
the control flow cycle.

\subsection{Components and How Integrated}


\subsection{Results from Tests/Analysis}

The initial beta group, consisting primarily of our sponsor Dr. Susan
Hess, response was reasonably positive. They submitted several bug
reports, and a few feature requests but overall provided fairly positive
feedback about the features that were functioning and fully implemented.

The response remained positive after we moved to a larger test group
including students and associates of our Dr. Hess. While Dr. Hess
continued to be the primary tester, submitting the majority of bug
reports and feature requests, the other users did not mention any
major concerns about the application.

We were also able to get some feedback during the Engineering EXPO.
This was also fairly positive. One of the biggest questions was if
we could, or if we planned, on expanding the application to other
instruments. We also had a number of non-bassoon players take a look
at the application and while they were initially confused about the
layout of the fingering chart, they appreciated the application for
the problem it solves.


\section{Future Work}

Work for this project is intended to continue next semester in order
to implement the current application on a mobile platform. Though
the current web application is usable via mobile browsers, a mobile
application would provide the flexibility and flow specific to mobile
devices.

In addition to a mobile version, the web application version would
be continued to include features available in the premium version
of the web application. These premium features would include, but
is not limited to the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Being able to hear the sound of each note as it is selected. 
\item Searching more than just standard fingerings, (i.e. the fingerings
searchable on the site will only be basic, and in order to view many
alternate fingerings one would have to pay for the app) 
\item A mobile optimized version of the site. 
\item Input of multiple fingering/note combinations. 
\item Searching of a fingering to find the note associated, in addition
to searching the note for the fingerings. 
\end{enumerate}
The implementation of a mobile application, as well as a premium web
application, would require a full semester to complete and could be
implemented by a future Computer Science Senior Design Team. \clearpage{}
