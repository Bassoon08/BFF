\section{Letter of Transmittal}

The subsequent report is a summary of the web application proposed
to allow bassoonists to search, access, and learn about new fingerings.
This report decries the motivation, importance, and benefits of the
project, as well as conceptual design, tasks, implementation details,
and final product of the project. 

The goal of this project was to develop a web application that would
allow bassoonists to perform the aforementioned tasks easily on personal
computers, tablets, or smartphones, as well as providing a social
hub for bassoonists of all skill levels. The final implementation
of the application is functional on all necessary devices mentioned,
and is usable via all common browsers, including mobile browsers.
Users are able to add, delete, edit, and search for fingerings, as
required. Users are also able to comment upon fingerings, as well
as 'like' or 'dislike' fingerings, as suggested for the social aspect
of the application. This report describes the implementation and integration
of these components, as well as decisions regarding their design.

Because additional features may be necessary for more verbose application,
the project is planned to be continued and implemented as a mobile
application for optimization on mobile devices. The application's
ownership will be transmitted via Heroku, where the application is
currently hosted. 


\section{Executive Summary}

We designed a web application that helps bassoonists of all skill
levels find and learn new fingerings with an easy to use interface.

Bassoon fingerings can be very difficult to learn, especially because
there can be multiple fingerings for one note. Beginners and professionals
alike have the need to lookup fingerings for a note, usually in a
specific passage, to be sure they are using the appropriate fingering.
Bassoonists need to be able to access this tool via a personal computer,
a tablet (iPad, etc.), or smart-phone (Android, iPhone, etc.), and
would need to be able to easily search for fingerings for a specific
note. They also need to be able to add new fingerings, edit and delete
fingerings, and 'like'/'dislike' fingerings, as well as view fingerings
based on skill level.

This application will be beneficial to many bassoonists because it
gives them an easy way to find fingerings for specific notes based
on their skill level. It also gives bassoonists a social medium for
sharing fingerings, as well as suggestions and preferences for certain
fingerings.


\section{Background}


\subsection{Motivation}

The Bassoon Fingering Finder Team is very interested in evolutionary
computation and artificial intelligence, as well as mobile applications.
This project will not only help bassoonists, but also allowed the
BFF team to explore methods for using evolutionary computation and
artificial intelligence in a full software project. Also, because
the application needed to be compatible across multiple platforms,
it also gave the team experience with compatibility and mobile applications.


\subsection{Need}

Currently bassoonists have very few options when it comes to finding
fingerings quickly (which many times imperative during a concert or
recital). There are books listing hundreds of standard fingerings,
as well as an mobile fingering application with limited capabilities.
Bassoonists need a way to access fingerings quickly and be able to
search for fingerings they need. Also, because bassoonists have no
social medium for discussing preferences or suggestions for fingerings,
or receiving help for certain fingerings, it would also be helpful
to have an application that not only helped bassoonists find fingerings,
but also allowed them to communicate with fellow bassoonists.


\subsection{Benefits}

This project will benefit bassoonists, from beginners to professionals,
and will provide a way for bassoonists to communicate through a bassoon
specific application. Bassoonists will be able to add, edit, delete,
view, and search for bassoon fingerings with an easy to use graphical
interface, as well as manage fingerings they have added, 'like'/'dislike'
fingerings, and access the application via personal computer or mobile
devices.

\subsection{Team Responsibilities}

Jacob's primary task was the infrastructure. He worked to get the
user authentication, time zone specification, and skill level functioning.
He setup the ability for users to be able to view and edit their 'profile'
information, containing their skill level, email address, etc. Once
those tasks were done, he moved to work on bug reports and assist
with the application section when needed.

Sasha's primary task was implementing the mailer and search capabilities.
The mailer was used to automatically email users when they registered
for the site, as well as when they forgot their password (the mailer
would email a new temporary password). Implementing the search involved
querying the database for appropriate fingerings, rating fingerings,
and sorting/prioritizing fingerings. She created an algorithm that
would appropriately rate fingerings based on their like/dislike scores
that would appropriately weight fingerings. This algorithm then took
into account the skill level of users and prioritized fingerings that
had skill levels close to the user's skill level. Thus, when users
searched for fingerings of a specific note, the resulting fingerings
were ordered to show users fingerings that were rated highly and that
are appropriate for the user's skill level. Sasha also designed and
completed the BFF poster for the Engineering EXPO. 

Max's primary task was the JavaScript, HTML5, \& CSS related parts.
He mainly worked on the HTML5+JavaScript canvas for the note/fingering
entry, editing, and display. He also worked on the browser side validation
JavaScripts for the various forms on the website. He worked on adapting
a free CSS template for use on the site and added various CSS rules
for things like tabs and tables. Lastly he handled filtering most
bug reports to their respective developers, i.e. filtering user bugs
to Jacob and search bugs to Sasha.


\section{Concepts Considered}


\subsection{Implementation Model: Web application vs. Fully Mobile}

Though the project proposal suggested the model be implemented via
a web application, our sponsor voiced the need to have the application
be functional on mobile devices as well. Though it would be an interesting
opportunity to build a fully mobile application, the team had no experience
with building mobile applications.


\subsection{Programming Language: Python/Django vs. Ruby/Rails}

Originally, we considered using python with the django web framework
to develop the application. Both languages are scripting languages
that lend themselves to web development. All members of the team had
experience working with Python and Django previously on the software
engineering project for CS383/384. However, Ruby/Rails is ubiquitous
in web development currently and would be an opportunity to learn
a new language and web framework.


\subsection{Applet Language: Java vs. Flash vs. JavaScript+HTML5 }

Java and flash are both often used in web development to build applets
and therefore are well supported on most modern PC browsers with up
to date plugins. However, mobile browsers this is not the case with
Java applets unable to run on Android and iPhone, and Flash only running
on newer versions of the Android OS. JavaScript+HTML5 is fairly new
but runs on any browser including mobile devices albeit with varying
levels of support for various features, and requires no extra plugins
to install and keep up to date.


\subsection{Validation Methods: In-house vs. Devise}

Because the application was fairly small and specific, the team decided
in-house validation may be easier and better suited to the application.
However, as the application continued to develop, it became a much
larger application than originally modeled. The validation plug-in,
Devise, provides built-in validation tools that are easy to integrate
with applications. Some of the features included:
\begin{itemize}
\item Basic users, including a username, password, and email
\item Administrative Flag
\item Basic functions for New, Show, Edit, and Delete
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Search Results Rating Algorithm: Ratio Rating vs. Confidence Interval
Rating}

The simple rating algorithm involved finding the ratio of `likes'
and `dislikes' of a fingering (i.e. likes divided by likes plus dislikes).
However, this rating algorithm could possibly rate fingerings inappropriately.
For example, if fingering one had 100 likes and 50 dislikes, while
fingering two had 1 like and no dislikes, fingering 2 would be rated
higher than fingering one, even though fingering 1 should be rated
higher.


\section{Concept Selection}


\subsection{Implementation Model: Web application vs. Fully Mobile}

Because the sponsor wanted a mobile application in addition to a web
application, the team decided to implement a mobile compatible web
application to cater to users of both PC's and mobile devices. The
team also had little knowledge of the programming language used for
iPhone development, Objective C. Creating a web application would
also extend the user base, which would be beneficial.


\subsection{Programming Language: Python/Django vs. Ruby/Rails}

The team decided that gaining experience working with Ruby on Rails,
which is ubiquitous in web application development, would be prudent.


\subsection{Applet Language: Java vs. Flash vs. JavaScript+HTML5}

Since the application was to be mobile device compatible JavaScript+HTML5
was chosen for the language of the applet that was to handle the entering,
display, and editing of bassoon key fingerings.


\subsection{Validation Methods: In-house vs. Devise}

After attempting to implement Devise on partially implemented application,
it became apparent that the application would no longer benefit from
Devise because it would be too difficult to integrate Devise with
the almost fully developed application. 


\subsection{Search Results Rating Algorithm: Ratio Rating vs. Confidence Interval
Rating}

The team decided to use a more accurate rating algorithm that take
into account the volume of likes/dislikes and how well received the
fingering is (i.e. if it is 'controversial'). The algorithm used is
as follows:

\[
(\hat{p}+z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}^{2}\pm z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sqrt{(\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})+z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}^{2}/4n)/n})/(1+z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}^{2}/n)
\]


Where $\hat{p}=\frac{1}{n}$ and $z=1.96$ (for a 95\% confidence
interval).


\section{System Architecture}


\subsection{Conceptual Design}

Conceptually, the web application is based on a Model-View-Controller
architecture (Figure 1): 
\begin{itemize}
\item The user interacts with the user interface (e.g. adding fingerings). 
\item The controller handles the input event from the user interface, and
converts the event into an appropriate user action understandable
for the model. 
\item The controller notifies the model of the user action (e.g. adding
the fingering to the database). The controller houses the class methods/functions,
while the model houses the structure of objects.
\item The database of fingerings interacts the controller when additions,
deletions, and queries are made for fingerings. 
\item A view queries the model to generate an appropriate user interface
(e.g. the view shows the fingering entered). The controller issues
an instruction to the view so it can render itself.
\item The user interface waits for user interactions, which restarts the
cycle.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[H]


\caption{MVC Architecture within BFF}


\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{MVC}

\end{figure}


The user interface for the application was one of the most important
components because it is what the users will see and interact with
to use the application. Initially Dr. Hess drafted bassoon fingering
charts, which we then used to design the user interface. Users are
able to click fingering holes on the chart interface and change the
way the hole is filled (1/4 covered, trill, fully covered, etc.).

\par\end{centering}

\centering{}\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{fingering_implement}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Components and Integration}

Again, the application is based on a Model-View-Controller architecture
(as seen in Figure 1). An example how the model, view, and controller
are integrated with each other is a user adding a fingering: 

The user interacts with the user interface (e.g. adding fingerings)
by clicking the fingering holes they wish to fill. By clicking the
'Submit' button, the controller is notified of an input event. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{User Entering Fingerings}


\centering{}\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{view_enter}
\end{figure}


The controller handles the 'Submit' event from the user interface,
and converts the event into an appropriate user action understandable
for the model. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{User Submitting Fingering}


\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{submit_add}
\par\end{centering}

\end{figure}


The controller notifies the model of the user action (e.g. internally
adding the fingering to the database).

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Controller Function for Adding Fingerings}


\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{controller_add}
\par\end{centering}

\end{figure}


The view queries the model to generate the view showing that the fingering
was successfully entered.

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Fingering Added to the Database}


\noindent \centering{}\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{database_add}
\end{figure}


The user interface waits for user interactions, which restarts the
cycle.

\medskip{}


This cycle applies to other components of the application, such as
editing a user profile, deleting fingerings, or searching fingerings. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Conceptual Flow of User Interaction}


\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{flow}
\par\end{centering}

\centering{}
\end{figure}


The application consists of both mobile and full site views. Though
both versions are fully functional, the mobile version is optimized
for mobile browsers. The application grants users the ability to input
new fingerings/note combinations, view and edit the user profile,
and search fingerings/note combinations.

\begin{figure}[H]


\caption{Mobile Site Examples}


\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{2.JPG}\qquad{}\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{6.JPG}
\par\end{centering}

\end{figure}


Administrators have increased access, including viewing all users,
which allows administrators to view, edit, or delete any other user
(in case of misuse). There is also a page to view all fingerings,
which allows administrators to approve new fingerings.

The users and fingerings are stored in a PostGres database. Information
is retrieved from the database and, based on the page the user is
interacting with, a page is rendered appropriately (using CSS to enforce
a similar style across the site). 


\subsection{Results from Tests/Analysis}

The initial beta group, consisting primarily of our sponsor Dr. Susan
Hess, response was reasonably positive. They submitted several bug
reports, and a few feature requests but overall provided fairly positive
feedback about the features that were functioning and fully implemented.

The response remained positive after we moved to a larger test group
including students and associates of our Dr. Hess. While Dr. Hess
continued to be the primary tester, submitting the majority of bug
reports and feature requests, the other users did not voice any major
concerns about the application.

We were also able to get some feedback during the Engineering EXPO,
which was positive. One of the biggest questions was if we could,
or if we planned, on expanding the application to other instruments.
We also had a number of non-bassoon players show interest in application
and appreciated the application for the problem it solves.


\section{Future Work}

Work for this project is intended to continue next semester in order
to implement the current application on a mobile platform. Though
the current web application is usable via mobile browsers, a mobile
application would provide the flexibility and flow specific to mobile
devices.

In addition to a mobile version, the web application version would
be continued to include features available in the premium version
of the web application. These premium features would include, but
is not limited to the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Being able to hear the sound of each note as it is selected. 
\item Searching more than just standard fingerings, (i.e. the fingerings
search-able on the site will only be basic, and in order to view many
alternate fingerings one would have to pay for the app) 
\item A mobile optimized version of the site. 
\item Input of multiple fingering/note combinations. 
\item Searching of a fingering to find the note associated, in addition
to searching the note for the fingerings. 
\end{enumerate}
The implementation of a mobile application, as well as a premium web
application, would require a full semester to complete and could be
implemented by a future Computer Science Senior Design Team. \clearpage{}
